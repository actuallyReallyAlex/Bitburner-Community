# Bitburner-Community

For inspiration, assistance, and discussion around the amazing cyperpunk-themed incremental RPG, Bitburner. Even though Bitburner is set in a dystopian future where you work alone in front of a green tinted monitor, that doesn't mean we can't create a thriving community to help each other out!

I've compiled every script that was ever mentioned in a post on the BitBurner subreddit, and placed them into folders for convenience. I encourage you to make edits, additions, and supply constructive criticism.

*Added scripts are verified to be able to run without a runtime error. If a script was posted as needing fixing, it was not added to this database. If an update made a workaround script obsolete, it was not added. If someone wrote a script similar to another script, just with different variables or a longer loop for example, only 1 of the scripts was added to the database.*

## Getting Started

If you haven't already subscribed, a good place to start is the [Bitburner subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitburner/).

## Management

Each script has been organized into a category. The categories are as follows:

* **Early-game** - *Scripts that are utilized when player skills are low, little/no augmentations installed, and limited access to servers.*
* **Middle-game** - *Scripts for when skills/augs allow player to be moderately successful with most servers and/or tasks.*
* **Late-game** - *High end server hacking, long optimizations, and scripts that may require lots of skills/augmentations to work effectively.*
* **Any** - *Scripts that are applicable to any point in the game.*
* **Hacknet** - *Scripts to manage, setup, or improve your hacknet experience.*
* **Stock Market** - *Scripts for managing the stock market.*
* **Calculations** - *Scripts that calculate/determine optimization or hacking details.*
* **Misc.**

There are also subfolders that seek to add context to the main function of the script.
